# An Iterative Cycle For Improving GPT Outputs

The purpose of this repository is to describe an iterative cycle for improving the effectiveness of prompts to a generative pre-trained tranformer (GPT).

This workflow was developed for working with ChatGPT although it may also work with other LLMs.

The workflow described here is simple but it might nevertheless provided a good foundational workflow for those looking to explore the capabilities of GPTs beyond naive prompting.
